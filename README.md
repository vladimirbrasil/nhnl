NH-NL Index calculation for other countries outside US

Este projeto começou em 2009 e seguiu publicando gráficos semanais para diversos países, usando a mesma fórmula, até pelo menos final de 2012.

## The New High – New Low Index in Worldwide Markets

One of the co-authors used to say to his students abroad that it was a pity the NH-NL did not exist in
countries outside the US. He used to challenge his audiences: modern software should make it possible
to create this indicator for your country. Download the daily data for all listed stocks and write a
formula that will tag and count any stocks that reach a new high or a new low for the year on any given
day. Traders in several countries kept saying this would be easy to program, but nobody ever delivered.
Then in 2009 we received an email from a private trader in Brazil named Vladimir Dietrichkeit. After
taking a class in Brazil he began sending us the New High – New Low charts for his country. We made a
few minor formatting suggestions, Vladimir implemented them, and afterwards his charts looked
perfect. He joined SpikeTrade and began posting NH-NL charts for several markets in which our
members were interested: Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, and others. We created a special link on the
main page of SpikeTrade for Vladimir’s weekly updates. This is now a free feature, open to all guests of
SpikeTrade as well as our members. All charts in this chapter were produced by Vladimir and marked up
by us.
